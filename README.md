### 📜 **About the Repository**
This repository contains implementations of various classic machine learning algorithms from scratch, written using only Python and NumPy. The goal is to help users understand the underlying mechanics of machine learning models and gain insight into their workings without relying on high-level libraries.

---

### ⚡ **Implemented Algorithms**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- And more...

---

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)

---
### 🚀 **Future**
- Making it in C++, Java and in Python (no external libraries)
