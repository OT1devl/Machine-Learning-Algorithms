### ⚡ **Implemented Algorithms**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- And more...

---

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)

### 📂 **How to Use**
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OT1devl/Machine-Learning-Algorithms.git
cd Machine-Learning-Algorithms
```
Each algorithm has its own folder containing the necessary code. To run any of the algorithms, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the Python script.

For example, to run the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm:
```bash
cd KNN
python knn.py
```
